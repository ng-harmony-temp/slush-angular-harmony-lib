## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool to be able to use Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To be able to provide functionality like Yeoman, see: [Yeoman like behavior below.](https://github.com/slushjs/slush#yeoman-like-behavior)
